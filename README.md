## :mag: Description
### Blackjack is a virtual card game where you are trying to get your hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Cards valued at 2-10, face cards worth 10, and aces worth either 1 or 11. I created this game as it is the only card game I play when I go to Vegas as well as to better understand how to advance a game with multiple states per turn. 
### See if you have what it takes to beat the dealer in this exciting game of Blackjack!

## **Getting Started**

### :pencil2: Instructions
1. Place a bet by clicking the `Bet $10` button.
1. Click `Deal` to start the hand.
1. Press `Hit` to receive another card until you have 21 or are as close as you're willing to risk to 21. Don't go over 21 or you will lose the hand and your current wager!
1. Click `Stay` to end your turn.
1. If you choose `Double Down`, you can double your bet before the dealer gives you another card. However, you will only receive one additional card and your turn is over.
1. The dealer must hit on a 16 or under, but anything 17 or above, the dealer stays.
1. If your cards total more than 21, the dealer wins and vice versa.
1. If your cards total less than 21 and more than the dealer, then you win and vice versa.
1. If you win, you will be rewarded 2x the current wager and if you tie, you will receive your wager back.
1. If your cards total exactly 21, your payout is 3:2. This means if you bet $10 and get a Blackjack then you will receive $15 back plus your original wager.
1. If you lose, your wager will be gobbled up by the dealer.
1. To start a new hand, simply place another wager of your choosing and hit `Deal`!
1. Once your purse is empty, the game will end and you must hit `Reset` to start over.
1. Good luck!
